    <h5 class="card-title">Banff</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Banff, located in the heart of the Canadian Rockies in Alberta, Canada, is a breathtaking mountain town that serves as the gateway to Banff National Park, the oldest national park in Canada and the third-oldest in the world. Established in 1885, the park covers more than 6,600 square kilometers of pristine wilderness and is part of the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks. The town of Banff itself is small, with a population of around 8,000 to 10,000 residents, but it attracts millions of visitors every year due to its stunning natural beauty, outdoor recreation, and charming alpine atmosphere. It is surrounded by snow-capped peaks, turquoise lakes, dense pine forests, and abundant wildlife, making it one of the most iconic and photographed destinations in Canada.

The region offers year-round attractions and activities for all types of travelers. In the summer months, visitors can enjoy hiking, mountain biking, canoeing, rock climbing, and wildlife watching. Popular hiking trails lead to scenic lookouts and glacial lakes such as Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, Peyto Lake, and Johnston Canyon. Each lake is known for its striking blue-green color, caused by glacial rock flour suspended in the water. Lake Louise and Moraine Lake are especially famous for postcard-perfect views and often serve as the backdrop for weddings, films, and travel photography. The Icefields Parkway, a highway that stretches between Banff and Jasper, is considered one of the most scenic drives in the world, offering countless photo opportunities and stops at majestic waterfalls, valleys, and glaciers.

During winter, Banff transforms into a snowy wonderland and becomes a hub for winter sports. The "Big 3" ski resorts—Banff Sunshine, Lake Louise Ski Resort, and Mt. Norquay—offer world-class skiing and snowboarding with spectacular mountain views. Snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, ice skating on frozen lakes, dog sledding, and ice climbing are also popular activities. SnowDays, a winter festival held in January, brings the town to life with ice sculpture contests, snow art, and family-friendly events.

The town of Banff is not just about nature—it's also full of culture, history, and hospitality. The streets are lined with cozy cafes, boutiques, souvenir shops, art galleries, and restaurants offering everything from local Canadian cuisine to international flavors. The Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies showcases the cultural heritage, art, and exploration history of the region, while the Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum focuses on the traditions of Indigenous peoples of the Rocky Mountains. One of the most iconic buildings in Banff is the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel, a grand, castle-like structure built in 1888. This historic luxury hotel offers views of the Bow River and is a destination in itself, with high-end dining, a spa, and even ghost stories that add to its mystique.

Banff is also home to the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, an internationally recognized arts institution that hosts events, performances, and residencies. It supports visual artists, writers, musicians, and dancers from around the world. The Banff Mountain Film and Book Festival, held every fall, celebrates the best in mountain culture through documentaries, storytelling, and adventure literature, attracting filmmakers, authors, and adventurers from around the globe.

One of Banff’s most unique features is its commitment to environmental preservation and sustainability. As part of a national park, development is carefully regulated to protect natural habitats and ensure that wildlife continues to thrive. Animals such as grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, elk, bighorn sheep, moose, and mountain goats roam the area, and visitors are often lucky enough to spot them from safe distances. Interpretive centers and park rangers help educate the public about conservation and respectful tourism.

The Banff Upper Hot Springs, located near the town, are a natural mineral-rich hot spring experience, open to the public year-round. Soaking in these steaming waters while surrounded by snow-covered mountains is a truly relaxing experience. Nearby, Sulphur Mountain offers access to the Banff Gondola, which lifts visitors to a summit boardwalk with panoramic views over the Bow Valley and nearby peaks.

Accessing Banff is relatively easy. The town is located about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Calgary, Alberta, and is connected by the Trans-Canada Highway. Many visitors arrive through Calgary International Airport, then take a shuttle or drive to Banff. The journey itself is scenic, passing through rolling foothills and dramatic mountain ranges.

In conclusion, Banff, Canada is a spectacular year-round destination where majestic landscapes, outdoor adventure, cultural richness, and natural wonder all come together. Whether you're drawn by the mountains, wildlife, lakes, winter sports, or simply the peaceful environment, Banff offers an unforgettable experience for travelers of all ages. It stands as a proud symbol of Canada's commitment to nature conservation, outdoor recreation, and cultural heritage.
