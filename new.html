    <h5 class="card-title">New York</h5>
    <p class="card-text">New York City is not just a city—it’s a world in itself. Buzzing with life 24/7, it pulses with energy, ambition, and a sense of endless possibility. Every street feels like a movie scene, every neighborhood tells a different story, and every visit feels like stepping into something bigger than yourself. Known as "The City That Never Sleeps," New York doesn’t slow down—and that’s exactly why people fall in love with it.

From the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan to the artistic corners of Brooklyn and the cultural vibrancy of Queens, New York is a mosaic of people, passions, and perspectives. You can spend the morning gazing at priceless art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, stroll through the greenery of Central Park by afternoon, and end the night with a Broadway show or rooftop view of the skyline. In New York, your itinerary can be as fast-paced or as free-spirited as you choose.

Iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty, Times Square, the Empire State Building, and the Brooklyn Bridge are just the beginning. The real magic of New York lies in the unexpected—a jazz band playing in a subway station, a quiet bookshop tucked into a busy block, a spontaneous conversation with someone from halfway across the world.

New York is also a paradise for food lovers. Whether you're eating dollar-slice pizza at 2 a.m., enjoying authentic dim sum in Chinatown, or savoring a five-star meal at a Michelin-starred restaurant, the city's culinary scene is unmatched. It’s a place where global flavors collide, and where every meal tells a story of culture and creativity.

The city thrives on diversity. With over 180 nationalities and 200+ languages spoken, New York is one of the most culturally rich places on Earth. Each neighborhood has its own soul—Harlem’s rhythm, Soho’s style, the Bronx’s grit, and the Upper East Side’s elegance. No matter where you're from, you’ll find a piece of home—and something entirely new—in New York.

At its core, New York is a city of dreams. People come here to make things happen: to create, to perform, to build, to believe. And whether you’re staying for a week or a lifetime, the city leaves a mark. It challenges you, inspires you, and reminds you that anything is possible.

New York City isn’t just a destination—it’s an experience. It’s bold, unpredictable, electric, and unforgettable.
