    <h5 class="card-title">Paris</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Paris is not just a destination—it’s a feeling. Known to the world as “La Ville Lumière,” the City of Light has a magic that goes far beyond its monuments. It is a place where the past and present merge in the cobblestone streets, elegant architecture, and the soft murmur of café conversations. Paris is where art meets life, where every street feels like a painting, and where beauty is in the details—from the iron balconies to the scent of fresh bread from the boulangerie on the corner.

What makes Paris truly unforgettable is the way it makes you feel. Mornings begin slowly here, with locals sipping espresso and reading newspapers in sun-drenched cafés. The city awakens with grace—bakeries open their shutters, florists begin arranging vibrant displays, and the quiet murmur of life gradually builds into a rhythm unique to this place. It's not just about seeing Paris; it's about experiencing it with all your senses.

Landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum draw visitors from around the globe, but the real soul of Paris often lies in its quieter corners. Wander through the artistic hills of Montmartre, where street painters work just steps from the famous Sacré-Cœur Basilica. Meander along the banks of the Seine River, browsing secondhand books from green stalls perched along the stone embankments. Or spend hours in a quiet garden, like the Luxembourg Gardens, watching children play with wooden sailboats in the fountain.

Paris is also a cultural capital. From world-class museums and historic theatres to avant-garde fashion houses and contemporary art galleries, the city pulses with creativity. The legacy of Picasso, Monet, Hemingway, and Chanel lives on in the ateliers, studios, and salons that still define Parisian style and spirit. It is a place where inspiration lingers in the air, where literature, cinema, and design are a way of life—not just an industry.

And then, of course, there's the food. Parisian cuisine is not just about eating—it’s about celebrating. Whether you’re enjoying a picnic of cheese and wine by the Eiffel Tower or dining at a fine restaurant in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, every meal feels meaningful. Each dish, no matter how simple, is crafted with care and tradition, turning everyday dining into a small act of joy.

At night, Paris transforms again. The Eiffel Tower sparkles on the hour, casting a golden glow over the cityscape. Street musicians play along the riverbanks. Wine bars and jazz clubs fill with soft laughter and conversation. There is an unmistakable intimacy in the way the city lights reflect in the Seine, and in the way people linger—on terraces, on benches, in small bookstores—never quite in a hurry to leave.

Paris is more than a place to visit. It’s a place to feel alive, to fall in love—with the city, with someone, or perhaps with yourself. It teaches you to slow down, to notice, and to appreciate the beauty in the ordinary.

A trip to Paris doesn’t end when you leave. It stays with you—in your memories, your senses, and your longing to return. Because once you've experienced Paris, it never really lets you go.
